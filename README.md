My name is Aleksandr. I'm currently learning Computer Vision, especially GAN's.

Here is a few links you can take a look at:

### Free-time projects:

| Project | Comment |
| ------- | --------------|
| [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](https://github.com/asisakov/Computer_Vision_Projects/tree/master/Deep\%20Convolutional\%20Generative\%20Adversarial\%20Networks) | Created Generative Adversarial Network, which was trained at the MNIST-Fashion dataset. Generative NN training is shown in the GIF-fle with outputs after each epoch. |
| [Neural Style Transfer using OpenCV](https://github.com/asisakov/Computer_Vision_Projects/tree/master/Neural\%20Style\%20Transfer) | Attempt to implement the artistic style of a painting on a video using the OpenCV library. Also applied a style transfer to streaming video from the camera. |
| [Web-page with printed Neural Network layers outputs](https://github.com/asisakov/Computer_Vision_Projects/tree/master/NN\%20layers\%20visualizer) | Created  flask server, where at each request, a random instance is selected from the MNIST dataset and passed through the neural network. Returns the output values of each layer. Web-interface to visualise layers outputs was created using streamlit package. |
| [Building of Docker container for flask app](https://github.com/asisakov/Computer_Vision_Projects/tree/master/DockerContainer) | Created flask server with image, where regression was plotted in temperature data. Application was builded to container using Dockerfile. |
| [Outlier detection in financial data](https://github.com/asisakov/Outlier-Detection) | Using of visualisation and clusterisation methods to find anomalies in unlabeled data. [Tried Dash visualisation for .csv data-file. Packed in Docker.](https://github.com/asisakov/plotly_dash_data_visualisation) |
| [McKinsey ProHack competition](https://github.com/asisakov/McKinsey-ProHack) | Prediction of the development index of "galaxies" using regression, solving the problem of optimal resource allocation between them. Initial data distribution is asymptotic, also it has NaNs. I wrote the pipeline myself. Top-40% solution. Used one-hot encoding, tried classical regression in combination with one-layer NN (pytorch). Optimization problem solved by own algorithm, checked using CVXPY. |
